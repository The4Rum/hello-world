# hello-world
My first repository
I have been using Plex Media Server and various Plex client apps for about 3 years. 
I have built a considerable libray composed of over 4,000 movies and TV shows.
I also have some music and photos.
My purpose to check out github is to write  or modify Plex Media Player to allow it to use an external player of my choice.
Ideally this will allow me to use a hardware player, specifically a Oppo UDH-203 Blu-ray player that can stream media.
The idea is to eliminate all the additional variables that may degrade the playback of re-muxed MKV files.  
Plex Media Player will in essence "pass-through" video as it does high-end audio allowing my home Theater equipment take in from there.
My hypothesis is that by "passing-through" the untouched video signal, my attached AVR and projector will need no further adjustment to the calibration I have done for original disc' play from this Blue-ray player.
